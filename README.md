  Container - the root component `<App>`.
- When you submit your homework, there is a link to a repository with the source code for the project.
- In the repository header, there is a link to a live page on `GitHub pages`.
- When visiting the working page (GitHub pages) of the job, there are no errors or
  warnings.
- There is a separate folder for each component with a React component file and a file of
  styles.
- The `propTypes` and, where necessary, `defaultProps` are described for the components.
- Whatever the component expects as props is passed to it when it is called.
- Component names are clear and descriptive.
- JS code is clean and clear, and `Prettier` is used.
- Styling is done only by `SASS`, `CSS modules`, or `Styled Components`,
  so the classes in the resulting DOM may differ from the examples.
